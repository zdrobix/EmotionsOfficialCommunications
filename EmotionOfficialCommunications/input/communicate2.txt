Well, actually, 2018 was one of the most important moments in NATO history.  It’s when President Trump at the NATO summit walked through the different contributions of different countries, some of whom were under 1 percent of GDP – less than 1 percent of their economy was being spent on defense.  Since that time we’ve seen improvements, and I can tell you that we are headed for a summit in six weeks in which virtually every member of NATO will be at or above 2 percent, but more importantly, many of them will be over 4 percent and all will have agreed on a goal of reaching 5 percent over the next decade.  It’ll be the first time ever in NATO history where they have reached targets and goals that will allow NATO partners to be more than 50 percent of the Alliance.  That’s a historic moment if it comes to fruition.  That’s what was agreed upon today by the foreign ministers.  And I think all of that tracks back to 2018 when President Trump challenged the members of the Alliance to step up.
